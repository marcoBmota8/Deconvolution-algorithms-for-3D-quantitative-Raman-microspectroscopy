# Deconvolution-algorithms-for-3D-quantitative-Raman-microspectroscopy

Here are some of the machine learning algorithms, data augmentation and validation (cross-validation) Python scripts that I developed as part of my master thesis at
The Stevens Lab @ Imperial College London Department of Bioengineering. 

The performance in terms of hyperspectral Raman data deconvolution and biochemical quantification accuracy results comparing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) -- default go-to algorithm in Chemometrics for Raman --, Hybrid Least Squares (HLA), Partial Least squares Regression(PLSR), Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternative Least Squares (MCR-ALS) and an unprecedented algorithm (Not yet disclossed) will be soon (summer-fall 2021) published in a high  impact publication.

These implementations showed state-of-the-art performancefirst in phantom data as validation, but also in brain and endometrial organoids 3D scans. These algorithms will set the
computational basis towards a platform technology that will enable biologists and clinicians to biochemically quantify any 3D biospecimen with submicron resolution and obtain their quantitative chemical 3D imaging.
