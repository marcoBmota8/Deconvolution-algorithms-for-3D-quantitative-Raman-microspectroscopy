# Deconvolution-algorithms-for-3D-quantitative-Raman-microspectroscopy

Here are some of the machine learning algorithms, data augmentation and validation (cross-validation) Python scripts that I developed as part of my master thesis at
The Stevens Lab @ Imperial College London Department of Bioengineering. 

The performance in terms of Hyperspectrasl Raman data deconvolution and biochemical quantification accuracy results comparing Hybrid Least Squares (HLA), 
Partial Least squares Regression(PLSR), Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternative Least Squares (MCR-ALS) and an unprecedented algorithm (Not yet disclossed) 
will be soon (summer-fall 2021) published in a high  impact publication.

These implementations showed state-of-the-art performancefirst in phantom data as validation, but also in brain and endometrial organoids 3D scans. These algorithms will set the
computational basis towards a platform technology that will enable biologists and clinicians to biochemically quantify any 3D biospecimen with submicron resolution.
